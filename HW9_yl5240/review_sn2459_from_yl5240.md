This plot has quite clear to show the trend of top 5 cities’ house price from Oct. 2016 to Sep. 2017.
Though, some details could be improved:
1) The y label. I suppose the unit should be $1000. ‘(1000s of $)’ is hard to understand.
2) The legend location. The center of a plot is not a good position for putting a legend. The reason is that it would be too eye-catching for a legend, which should just be an element for   supplementary instruction.
3) The x lim. Because the lowest city, Philadelphia, is below 200k(?), the xlim could be set as (0,1000).  Such change of making the lowest higher and the highest lower in the plot, will make the lines more clustered in the center of the plot, and also offer the space for putting the legend on the upper-left.
4) The title. It is better to describe the period of Oct. 2016 to Sep. 2017 in the plot.
