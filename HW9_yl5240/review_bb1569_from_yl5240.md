The plot below is from HW8 of Brusco Bianca, bb1569. It could be found on https://github.com/biabbiassago/PUI2017_bb1569/tree/master/HW8_bb1569.

**This plot this pretty impressive to me: clear, beautiful, and informative.**


I have checked the definition of the term temperature anomaly and its common used areas. Brusco has used this term in this plot quite precisely. On NOAA’s [website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201710#temp)(Brusco’s data source is also from this institution), some plots of global surface mean temp anomalies could be found.


Nonetheless, some **improvements** could be made for this plot:
1) The meaning of the **color gradient** is not expressed on the plot. Although it’s not hard to speculate that darker for higher anomaly, both positive and negative, you cannot suppose readers have the ability or obligation to understand what you’ve not stated. Furthermore, the deviation extent has been reflected on the height of the bar, so there’s no need to use the color gradient to do it again. In a word, This coloring is not only an unclear expression, but also redundancy.
2) It would be better to set a secondary y-axis on the right measured as degree centigrade. For the readers of non-American, it’s hard to get effective information from Fahrenheit degree.
